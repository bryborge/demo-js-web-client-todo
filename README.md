# Demo: Web-based Client-side To Do App

Built with React and Redux using Test-driven development (TDD).

## Built With

*   [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - A single-command bootstrapping framework for client-side React applications.
*   [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - Predictable, maintainable global state management.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) - A free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

### Installation

1.  Install the project dependencies

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2.  Start the application in development mode (which watches for file changes and reloads as needed)

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    Alternatively, you can start the application manually after applying file changes

    ```sh
    npm run start
    ```

### Testing

Unit testing was done using the built-in [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) package, which at the time of this writing is pretty
much the defacto standard in the React development ecosystem.

To run the tests, simply issue the command:

```sh
npm test
```
